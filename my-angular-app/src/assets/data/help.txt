**/logs/debug.log

# Ignore all files in the 'local_data' folder within the 'src' directory
src/local_data/*

# Ignore all log files except for 'important.log'
*.log
!important.log

# Ignore files generated by a specific editor (e.g., Sublime Text temporary files)
*~
.#*

1. Configure the global excludes file location 
git config --global core.excludesFile "%USERPROFILE%\.gitignore_global"
touch ~/.gitignore_global
Add patterns 
# macOS system files
.DS_Store

# Windows thumbnail cache
Thumbs.db

# Common editor/IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*~  # Backup files ending with ~

# Log files
*.log

. Verify the configuration
git config --global core.excludesFile

Pubslish Code

To publish code from Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to an online website, you generally use an extension specific to your hosting service or a generic method like FTP/FTPS or Git-based deployment. VS Code itself is an editor and does not have built-in publishing tools for web hosting in the way Visual Studio IDE does. 
Here are common methods for publishing your code:
Method 1: Using Platform-Specific Extensions (Recommended) 
Many hosting providers offer dedicated VS Code extensions that streamline the deployment process. 
Microsoft Azure: The Azure App Service extension allows you to create and deploy web apps directly to Azure with a few clicks. The free tier for personal projects is very generous.
GitHub Pages: For static websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript only), you can use the built-in "Publish to GitHub" command to create a repository and then configure GitHub Pages to host it for free.
Other Platforms (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Render.com): These services also offer simple deployment by linking to your GitHub repository. While they may not have official VS Code extensions for direct deployment, you can push your code to a GitHub repo using VS Code's source control features, and the hosting service will automatically deploy it. 

Method 2: Using FTP/FTPS Extension
If your hosting provider offers FTP/FTPS access, you can use an extension like "ftp-sync" or "Remote - FTP" to upload your files. 
Install the Extension: Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for an FTP extension.
Configure Settings: You'll need your host's FTP details (server address, username, password, port) from your hosting control panel.
Deploy: Use the extension's commands to connect to your server and upload your project files. 

Method 3: Manual Deployment (Using a Build Folder)
For projects that require a build step (like React, Angular, or Node.js with Express), you often need to generate the static files first. 
Run a Build Command: Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+) and run your project's build command (e.g., npm run buildordotnet publish). This creates a publishorbuild` folder containing the deployable assets.
Upload Files: Manually upload the contents of this output folder to your web host's server using one of the methods above (e.g., FTP client, command line tools, or a deployment extension). 
Important Considerations
Static vs. Dynamic Sites: GitHub Pages is great for static content. If your website uses a back-end (like Node.js, PHP, or Python), you will need a hosting service that supports server-side code, such as Azure App Service, Vercel, or a traditional web host.

Version Control: Regardless of your method, it is highly recommended to use Git and services like GitHub to track your code changes and facilitate deployment. 


Publishing code from Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to an online website is typically done through hosting extensions or by connecting your local repository to a cloud platform. As of 2026, the most common methods include: 
1. GitHub Pages (Best for Static Sites) 
Ideal for simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript websites. 
Step 1: Initialize a Git repository in VS Code and push your code to a GitHub repository.
Step 2: In VS Code, install the Deploy to GitHub Pages extension.
Step 3: Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), type Deploy to GitHub Pages, and follow the prompts to publish. 

2. Azure App Service (Best for Full-stack Apps) 
Recommended for .NET, Node.js, Python, or Java applications. 
Step 1: Install the Azure App Service extension.
Step 2: Sign in to your Azure account via the Azure icon in the Activity Bar.
Step 3: Right-click your project folder in the Explorer or App Service name in the Azure view and select Deploy to Web App. 

3. Vercel or Netlify (Best for React, Vue, Next.js) 
These services offer seamless VS Code integration through their respective Command Line Interfaces (CLI). 
Step 1: Connect your VS Code project to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
Step 2: Link your Vercel or Netlify account to the repository.
Step 3: Any push to your main branch from VS Code will automatically trigger a new build and publish your site online. 

4. Direct SFTP/FTP (Standard Hosting) 
If you have traditional web hosting (e.g., Bluehost, Hostinger), you can upload files directly. 
Step 1: Install an extension like sftp.
Step 2: Configure the sftp.json file with your server's host, username, and password.
Step 3: Right-click a file or folder and select Upload to sync it with your online server. 

5. Google Cloud Run
Step 1: Install the Cloud Code extension.
Step 2: Use the Deploy to Cloud Run command from the Command Palette to build and host your service. 
Tip: Before publishing, always test your site locally using the Live Server extension to ensure everything displays correctly.

Yes, if you include credentials directly in a file like sftp.json and upload it to a public GitHub repository, those credentials will be visible to anyone who views the repository's history, even if you try to delete the file later [1]. This is a significant security risk. 
To manage credentials and sensitive data securely with GitHub, you should follow these best practices:

Use Environment Variables: Instead of hardcoding credentials in your code or configuration files, use environment variables to load them at runtime. Your application retrieves the credentials from the environment when it runs, not from the repository itself.

Utilize GitHub Secrets: For actions or deployments within GitHub, store sensitive information as GitHub Secrets, which are encrypted and not exposed in logs.

Add the file to .gitignore: Prevent files containing secrets from being accidentally committed by adding their names (e.g., sftp.json, .env) to a .gitignore file in your repository's root directory.

Consider a Secrets Management Service: For more complex applications, use a dedicated secrets management service like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

Audit and Remove Leaked Credentials: If you accidentally push credentials, you must treat them as compromised immediately. Remove them from your repository's history (a non-trivial process) and invalidate/rotate the credentials in the service they are for. GitHub provides a useful guide on removing sensitive data from a repository. 

Never commit any sensitive information, including passwords, API keys, or security tokens, to a public repository. 


Method 3: Using .htaccess (Force Subfolder Load)
If you cannot change the document root, you can create or edit a .htaccess file in the root folder (public_html) to point to your subfolder. 
Open File Manager in cPanel.
In the public_html folder, create a new file named .htaccess (or edit the existing one).
Add the following code (replace subfolder with your actual folder name):
apache
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.)?yourdomain.com$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/subfolder/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /subfolder/$1 [L]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.)?yourdomain.com$
RewriteRule ^(/)?$ subfolder/index.html [L]

To exclude sensitive configuration files, add .env and sftp.json to your .gitignore file. Open or create a .gitignore file in your project root and add each file on a new line to prevent accidental commit of credentials. 
text
# .gitignore file
.env
sftp.json
Key Notes for .gitignore:
.env: Crucial for ignoring API keys, database credentials, and secret variables.
sftp.json: Used to ignore deployment configuration files containing server login details.
Location: The .gitignore file should be placed at the root of your repository.
Existing Files: If these files were already tracked by git, you must remove them from the repository (while keeping them locally) using git rm --cached .env and git rm --cached sftp.json.
Best Practice: Create a .env.example file with placeholder values and commit that instead. 

1. Manual Creation or Transfer (Most Common)
The standard practice for sensitive or environment-specific files like these is to create them manually on the new machine or environment and populate them with the correct, specific information for that environment.
Manual Copying: You can manually copy the files to the new project directory using methods like USB drives, secure file transfer (SFTP/SCP), or shared drives.
Template Files: A common and recommended practice is to commit a template version of the file (e.g., sftp.json.example or .env.template) that has generic placeholders [1].
The template is tracked by Git.
In the new environment, you copy the template (cp .env.template .env) and fill in the actual sensitive data locally. This keeps the actual secrets out of the repository while providing clear instructions on what variables are needed [1]. 

2. Use a Secrets Management System
For professional or team environments, a secrets manager is a secure and scalable solution. 
Sensitive information is stored in a dedicated, secure system (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk).
The new project environment uses API keys or specific credentials to programmatically fetch the correct sftp.json or .env contents at runtime or during a deployment process. 

3. Temporarily Remove from .gitignore (Not Recommended for Secrets) 
You could technically remove the file from .gitignore, commit it, pull it on the new machine, and then re-add it to .gitignore. However, this is a significant security risk as it exposes sensitive information (credentials, API keys, etc.) in your repository's history forever [1]. Avoid this method for sensitive data. 
Summary
The core principle is that sftp.json and .env contain environment-specific or sensitive data that should not be in your public source control [1]. The best approach is to manage these files outside of Git using templates, manual creation, or a dedicated secrets manager.
