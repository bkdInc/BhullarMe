Use the shortcut `Ctrl + `` (Control + backtick) or go to the top menu and select View > Terminal.
Stage Your Changes:
This command adds all modified and new files to the staging area, preparing them for a commit.
bash
git add .
Commit Your Changes:
This command records the staged changes in your local repository's history with a descriptive message.
bash
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
Push to GitHub:
This command uploads your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.

Pubslish Code

To publish code from Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to an online website, you generally use an extension specific to your hosting service or a generic method like FTP/FTPS or Git-based deployment. VS Code itself is an editor and does not have built-in publishing tools for web hosting in the way Visual Studio IDE does. 
Here are common methods for publishing your code:
Method 1: Using Platform-Specific Extensions (Recommended) 
Many hosting providers offer dedicated VS Code extensions that streamline the deployment process. 
Microsoft Azure: The Azure App Service extension allows you to create and deploy web apps directly to Azure with a few clicks. The free tier for personal projects is very generous.
GitHub Pages: For static websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript only), you can use the built-in "Publish to GitHub" command to create a repository and then configure GitHub Pages to host it for free.
Other Platforms (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Render.com): These services also offer simple deployment by linking to your GitHub repository. While they may not have official VS Code extensions for direct deployment, you can push your code to a GitHub repo using VS Code's source control features, and the hosting service will automatically deploy it. 
Method 2: Using FTP/FTPS Extension
If your hosting provider offers FTP/FTPS access, you can use an extension like "ftp-sync" or "Remote - FTP" to upload your files. 
Install the Extension: Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for an FTP extension.
Configure Settings: You'll need your host's FTP details (server address, username, password, port) from your hosting control panel.
Deploy: Use the extension's commands to connect to your server and upload your project files. 
Method 3: Manual Deployment (Using a Build Folder)
For projects that require a build step (like React, Angular, or Node.js with Express), you often need to generate the static files first. 
Run a Build Command: Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+) and run your project's build command (e.g., npm run buildordotnet publish). This creates a publishorbuild` folder containing the deployable assets.
Upload Files: Manually upload the contents of this output folder to your web host's server using one of the methods above (e.g., FTP client, command line tools, or a deployment extension). 
Important Considerations
Static vs. Dynamic Sites: GitHub Pages is great for static content. If your website uses a back-end (like Node.js, PHP, or Python), you will need a hosting service that supports server-side code, such as Azure App Service, Vercel, or a traditional web host.

Version Control: Regardless of your method, it is highly recommended to use Git and services like GitHub to track your code changes and facilitate deployment. 


Publishing code from Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to an online website is typically done through hosting extensions or by connecting your local repository to a cloud platform. As of 2026, the most common methods include: 
1. GitHub Pages (Best for Static Sites) 
Ideal for simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript websites. 
Step 1: Initialize a Git repository in VS Code and push your code to a GitHub repository.
Step 2: In VS Code, install the Deploy to GitHub Pages extension.
Step 3: Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), type Deploy to GitHub Pages, and follow the prompts to publish. 
2. Azure App Service (Best for Full-stack Apps) 
Recommended for .NET, Node.js, Python, or Java applications. 
Step 1: Install the Azure App Service extension.
Step 2: Sign in to your Azure account via the Azure icon in the Activity Bar.
Step 3: Right-click your project folder in the Explorer or App Service name in the Azure view and select Deploy to Web App. 
3. Vercel or Netlify (Best for React, Vue, Next.js) 
These services offer seamless VS Code integration through their respective Command Line Interfaces (CLI). 
Step 1: Connect your VS Code project to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
Step 2: Link your Vercel or Netlify account to the repository.
Step 3: Any push to your main branch from VS Code will automatically trigger a new build and publish your site online. 
4. Direct SFTP/FTP (Standard Hosting) 
If you have traditional web hosting (e.g., Bluehost, Hostinger), you can upload files directly. 
Step 1: Install an extension like sftp.
Step 2: Configure the sftp.json file with your server's host, username, and password.
Step 3: Right-click a file or folder and select Upload to sync it with your online server. 
5. Google Cloud Run
Step 1: Install the Cloud Code extension.
Step 2: Use the Deploy to Cloud Run command from the Command Palette to build and host your service. 
Tip: Before publishing, always test your site locally using the Live Server extension to ensure everything displays correctly.
